# GREENING
The GREENING open-source framework delivers fast, energy-efficient algorithms optimized for low-power devices. It utilizes reduced precision techniques to modify the internal workings of the algorithms and High Performance Computing (HPC) methods to accelerate their execution.

## Algorithms
- **feature_selection_domain_adaptation_pso:**
  Feature selection for domain adaptation using complexity measures and swarm intelligence.

- **mrnet_parallelization:**
  Parallel implementations of the MRNET algorithm for inferring gene regulatory networks, optimized for CPU and GPU.
